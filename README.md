### A Soulful Beginning: <br>
Unlike most colleges, where induction begins with loud music 🎶 or dance performances💃, our journey into college life began with a peaceful and powerful,a spiritual path at the college Gurudwara Sahib🙇. It was not just an event, it was a moment of gratitude, and positivity, a soulful welcome into a new chapter of our lives🙏. This divine reminding me that education is not just about books, but about values, respect, and inner growth🙂.

### From Spiritual Warmth to a Grand Welcome:

One of the most memorable moments of our induction program was the presence of a special guest - a respected political leader Mr.Garewal sir, whose words left a deep impact on all of us💯. Unlike the usual formal speeches, their talk was filled with real-life experiences and powerful messages about responsibility, and the role of youth in shaping the nation💫.
They didn’t just speak to us - they connected with us. They tell the importance of education that it is not a personal success, but as a responsibility to uplift society📈. 

### Exploring Our Future: 
### The Electrical Engineering Department: <br>
After the inspiring session we get a break and then we were taken on a guided tour of the campus - a moment filled with excitement. The best part was visiting our own department: EE⚡. As i go into the classrooms and labs, i could already thinking myself as engineer in the making🧑‍🔧.
The faculty explained the purpose of each lab - from electrical machines to circuits and control systems, giving us a glimpse of learning that will we soon experience. Seeing the equipment, computers, circuits and technology sparked a sense of motivation and pride. It was not just about seeing rooms and machines but it was about stepping into our future🫶.

This was the experience of my very first day in college ✔️ and i truly ready to step into this new phase of life….✍️

The next day was an exciting journey into the heart of practical learning 🛠⚡. We visited our college workshops, including Foundry, Fitting, Machine, Welding, Electric, and Carpentry. Each workshop gave us a glimpse into the real-world applications of engineering, filling us with curiosity and enthusiasm to learn more🤓. I attend the foundey workshop😄. Here, I learned how molten metal is poured into moulds to create strong and precise components. It gave me a real taste of practical engineering and showed how theory turns into reality. They also told the importance of these workshops apart from engineering ⚡. Truly, studying engineering or doing something practical is totally different, i am so excited to leran this🙂. 



And my overall college experience - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
